Basic calculator

This module provide functionalities for performing basic arithmetic
calculations and processing data on lists of numbers. It includes
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
and advacned data processng function like finding the average,
mainumn, and minimum of a set of numbers.

Fuctions:
    - main(): Main entry point for the calculator program.
    - basic_calculation(): Handle arithmetic operations between two numbers.
    - proceed_data(): Processes a list of numbers for advanced calculations.
    - show_history(): Displays a history of calculations.
    - assign_history_value(): Assigns a value, allowing use of previous results.
    - get_integer(): Gets valid integer from user

Classes:
    - None in this module.

Usage example:
    - Run main() to start calculator:

    >>>main()   
"""


from numpy import average as avg

history = {}
def main():
