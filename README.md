## Description

This repository contains a collection of my projects where I practice and showcase my skills in various areas of developming. Each project demonstrates different aspects of my capabilities, ranging from simple scripts to complex applications.

The projects in this repository cover a diffrent areas:

- **C language Projects**: Expolre my C project which demonstrate the skills I learned through the CS50 course from Harvard University.
- **Python laguage Projects**: Dive into my Python projects, to which I am currently paying most of my attention.

Stay tuned for additional projects and languages as I continue to improving my skills and portfolio. Feel free to explore the repository, and don't hesitate for reaching out if you have any question or suggestion!
